# Home Security System

All over the world there are various kinds of Home Scurity Systems, and there are also a log of effective systems for Home Security.
Nowadays the AI has been introduced to a lot of fileds and I also used the AI for Home Security System.
Exactly it is one of the computer vision technique named Object Detection, Action Recognition and Face Recognition.
There are a lot of deep learning models to implement those techniques and I used Faster R-CNN.
Even though the Faster R-CNN is the old object detection deep learning model, but it is still useful for some object detection area
